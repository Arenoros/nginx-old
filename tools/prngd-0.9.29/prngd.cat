      PRNGD is the Pseudo Random Number Generator Daemon.  It offers an EGD
      compatible interface to obtain random data and is intended to be used
      as an entropy source to feed other software, especially software based
      on OpenSSL.

      Like EGD (http://sourceforge.net/projects/egd/) it calls system
      programs to collect entropy.  Unlike EGD it does not generate a pool
      of random bits that can be called from other software.

      Rather it feeds the bits gathered into its internal PRNG from which
      the "random bits" are obtained when requested. This way, PRNGD is
      never drained and can never block (unlike EGD), so it is also suitable
      to seed inetd-started programs.

      It also features a seed-save file, so that it is immediately usable
      after system start.

 UUUUSSSSAAAAGGGGEEEE
      Startup - (reads the seed file)
       /usr/local/bin/prngd [other options] /var/run/egd-pool

      Clean shutdown - (saves current data to the seed file)
       /usr/local/bin/prngd --kill /var/run/egd-pool

      The above line should be added to the system startup files so that
      prngd starts up before any program that would query the random data
      socket, such as OpenSSH.

      PRNGD supports both UNIX sockets (as shown in the examples) as well as
      TCP sockets (localhost only!). There is no port number registered
      (yet), so pick a free port on your system, e.g. 708 when running with
      root perms and you want to offer it as a system service, or 4840
      without root perms.

      Both ports are not assigned to any service as of
       http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/port-numbers

      To have PRNGD listen on both the Unix socket and TCP do
       prngd [other options] /var/run/egd-pool tcp/localhost:708
      tcp/localhost:4840

      You should add these lines to /etc/services: (substitute your chosen
      ports)
       prngd         708/tcp     # prngd/EGD system service
       prngd-user    4840/tcp    # prngd/EGD user service

      PRNGD itself by now only handles numerical port numbers.

      PRNGD has the following options:

      -c / --cmdfile file
          Read the entropy gathering commands from "file" instead of reading
          from the compiled in default location.

      -d / --debug
          Do not go into daemon (background) mode and print diagnostic
          messages to stderr.

      -f / --fg
          Stay in foreground, do not fork. Do not print diagnostic messages.
          This is e.g. usefull when using AIX System Resource Controller, so
          that the resource controler could detect a crash of prngd.

      -k / --kill
          Kill the _d_a_e_m_o_n(s) at the locations given. It is possible to kill
          more than one prngd at a time with this command. If several
          locations are given at one time, prngd will try to contact them
          one after the other, query the process id according to the EGD
          protocol and send a SIGTERM to the process. As one daemon may
          server more than one socket, one may wish to kill the daemon with
          the same argument that was used to start prngd.  The kill
          operation will however only succeed for the first socket, as the
          daemon will be killed in the first attempt. prngd -k ... will
          therefore silently ignore the failure at the other _l_o_c_a_t_i_o_n(s).

      -m / --mode mode
          Set the file access mode of the UNIX socket to be "mode". The mode
          is set after creation of the socket. This option can be used to
          restrict access to prngd. If more than one UNIX socket is served
          by prngd, the same mode setting applies to all UNIX sockets. The
          mode must be given in numeric notation, e.g. 777 for read and
          write and execute permission for owner/group/other.

      -n / --no-seedfile
          Do not read from any seedfile and do not create a seedfile or
          write to any seedfile.

      -p / --pidfile file
          Write the pid of the prngd process into the specified file. If
          this option is not explicitly used, no pid-file will be written,
          as prngd -k can be used to kill a running prngd.

      -s / --seedfile file
          Location of the seedfile. The file is read at startup to initially
          seed the PRNG. On clean shutdown entropy is retrieved from the
          pool and written back to the file. If no location is given, the
          compiled in location of the seedfile is used. If the seedfile does
          not exist on startup, it is created automatically.

      -v / --version
          Print the version of prngd and exit.
